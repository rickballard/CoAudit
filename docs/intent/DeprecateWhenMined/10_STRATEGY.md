# 10_STRATEGY — CoSuite Evolution System for Auditors

Flow: **Observe → Compare → Advise → Measure**

**Policy & Comparators**: Maintain living references to best practices.
**Controls**: Map advisories to control IDs; track coverage.
**Evidence**: Store hashes, links, logs under 60_DATA.
**Telemetry**: Rebuild indices; mark stale; compute closure scorecards.
**Hands-Off**: Only emit artifacts in this folder; never touch other repos.
