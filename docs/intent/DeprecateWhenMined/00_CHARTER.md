# 00_CHARTER — Hands-Off by Design

CoAudit:
- **Observes** CoSuite repos and the wider Internet.
- **Compares** against public standards, exemplars, and controls.
- **Advises** via signed, versioned *Evolutionary Advisory Units (EAUs)*.
- **Measures** via replies received and scorecards.

Non-interference rules:
- No commits, issues, PRs, labels, or settings changes in other repos.
- No org-level settings changes.
- Only artifacts produced **inside CoAudit** (data, docs, receipts, scorecards).
- Outgoing materials are **copy-pasteable** by executors; CoAudit never pushes them.

Trust posture:
- Every advisory has provenance (sources), confidence level, freshness window, and expiry.
- All outputs get hashes; indices are reproducible from data files.
